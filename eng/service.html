			<div class="page-content01">
            <p>The Japan Association for working holiday makers provides help and advice to people visiting Japan on Working Holiday Visas and to Japanese youths planning to travel abroad. We also provide working holiday makers with a job referral service. Another important aspect of our work is to promote awareness of the Working Holiday Scheme in Japan.<br />
Our offices are friendly, relaxed places where working holiday makers are welcome to pop in to receive useful advice, information, and encouragement.<br />
The purpose of the Working Holiday Scheme is to promote understanding between participating countries, and it is our hope that by staying in Japan on a Working Holiday Visa you will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Japanese culture, and that you in turn, will act as an unofficial cultural ambassador and help the people, you interact with, to gain a better understanding of your culture too.</p></div>
