                <h5>・ What kind of work can I do  on a Working Holiday Visa?</h5>
                <p>As a working holiday maker you don&rsquo;t have any restrictions on  working hours   or types of jobs with the exception of certain jobs like  host/hostess work, work in massage parlours etc., which Working Holiday Visa  holders   are not permitted to engage in. <br />
        While most Working holiday makers work as a language teacher,    others find work in restaurants, hotels, ski resorts, etc, although   these  non-teaching jobs usually require a certain level of Japanese   conversation  ability. While the wage depends on the area, the hours and the type of job,  non-teaching jobs do tend to have lower wage than teaching   jobs, though of  course there are exceptions. Recently, a number of   working holiday makers have  found IT-related offices jobs that require   only a minimum of Japanese ability.  While the wage may be lower,   non-teaching jobs give you the opportunity to work  in a   Japanese-language environment which can help you to gain a clearer    understanding of Japanese society and improve your Japanese. </p>
                
                <h5>・ Is there a limit to how  much work I can do on a Working Holiday Visa?</h5>
                <p>No. However remember that the aim of the working holiday  scheme is to   promote understanding and friendship between countries, and work    shouldn&rsquo;t be your primary motivation for coming to Japan on a Working   Holiday  Visa. There is no limit on how many hours or days per week or   how many months  you can work on a Working Holiday Visa in Japan.</p>
                
                <h5>・ How is the job market at  the moment?</h5>
                <p class="fap-sen1">The current recession is affecting wages and the number of  jobs that   are available. The job market for working holiday makers has been    getting tougher for several years because of poor economic conditions   and also  an increase in the number of people coming to Japan looking   for work. However, if  you are over 21 and have a university degree you   should be able to find work in  Japan  eventually if you aren’t overly   particular. It is absolutely essential to bring  enough money to survive   on until you find a job and to tide you over if you  suddenly become   unable to work or lose your job.<br />
        It used to be fairly easy to find a job as an English    teacher, but due to the large numbers of people coming to Japan seeking    jobs in this field, it is becoming a little more difficult. On average,   it  takes newcomers about one to two months to secure a teaching   position. During  this time it can be quite difficult emotionally,   mentally, and financially and  it really is important to make sure you   bring enough money to survive on while  you search for work.</p>
                
                <h5>・ How much is the average wage  for Working Holiday Makers?</h5>
                <p>Wages for language teaching jobs in Japan have been  dropping in recent   years. The most common hourly wage for language teaching  jobs in our   job files is approximately 2,000 yen, though wages do range from  about   1500 yen to about 3000 yen. The wage for non-teaching jobs in our job    files is approximately 1000 yen per hour.</p>
                
                <h5>・ What kind of work do you provide in your files?</h5>
                <p>The most common kind of job in our files is language  teaching   (especially English). Waiter staff/hotel staff jobs are the next most    common. Recently there have also been a number of office jobs.<br/> You will find all job offers <a target="blank" href="http://www.job-board.info/"> HERE </a></p>
                
                <h5>・ Is it more difficult to  find work in Japan  without a university degree?</h5>
                <p>Yes, it is more difficult to find teaching jobs in Japan without a    degree, especially in the major cities. Many employers require   applicants to  have a degree, but there are exceptions. Teaching jobs   that don’t require  degrees tend to have lower wages. In the case of   unskilled non-teaching jobs,  fewer employers require a degree, but   conversational-level Japanese is  usually required, and in many   cases a high level of Japanese proficiency is  required.<br />
      		If you are planning to come to Japan in a gap year before    continuing on to university, it is important to be aware that not having   a  degree and being under the age of 21 does make it more difficult to   find work.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Is it more difficult to  find work in Japan  if you’re under 21?</h5>
                <p>Yes. It does tend to be difficult for people under the age  of 21 to   find work, and some unfortunately return home disappointed (see above).    English schools usually require teachers to be over 21 years of age,   but with  non-teaching jobs it doesn’t seem to be so much of an issue.   Your chances of  finding such work increase if you can speak Japanese.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Do I need to be able to  speak Japanese to find teaching work?</h5>
                <p>No, but being able to speak Japanese is often an advantage  when you are looking   for work, and when interacting with Japanese colleagues, even if  you   aren’t required to speak Japanese in your daily work. You might be    surprised by how many people there are in Japan who are unable to speak    English. We recommend that you try to learn some Japanese before you   leave for Japan, as it  will likely make your stay a lot more enjoyable   and fulfilling. </p>
                
                <h5>・ Is it possible to find  skilled non-teaching work if you can’t speak Japanese?</h5>
                <p>It does tend to be difficult to find skilled non-teaching  work that   doesn’t require a certain level of Japanese ability, but it very much    depends on your other abilities and your field of work. Jobs in the   service  industry usually require a high degree of Japanese ability.  Sometimes people with high levels of expertise in certain fields find employment even though they don't speak Japanese. However, such people are rather the exception.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Can I find work before I  arrive in Japan?</h5>
                <p>It depends on your country's Working Holiday Visa  conditions. Citizens   of some countries are allowed to and others are not.  Please contact   your nearest Japanese Embassy or Consulate for information. The    J.A.W.H.M. cannot give out information on the job files that we have in   our  office to you, until you have registered in person at one of our   offices. This  is to ensure that access to the information is restricted   to Working Holiday  Makers who are registered with us.</p>
                
                <h5>・ How long does it usually  take to find a job after arriving in Japan?</h5>
                <p>It usually takes between 2 weeks to 2 months, though of  course, it very   much depends on the person and the time of year. Some people  find work   almost immediately while some people find it very difficult. Though  is   quite rare, occasionally there are people who fail to find any work at   all  and have to end their working holiday earlier than expected.</p>
                
                <h5>・ When is the best time to  find work in Japan?</h5>
                <p>Many teaching jobs start in early April (April is the start  of the   academic and financial year in Japan),  so February and the start of   March tends to be a good time to look for a teaching  work in Japan.  Job   openings for non-teaching work tends to be more evenly spread out through    the year. It is very difficult to find any kind of work right before   or during  the New Year period, and the ‘Golden Week’ holiday period   starting at the end  of April. Most companies close during these holiday   periods, and hotels,  trains, and planes tend to be fully booked. Peak   rates apply during the New  Year and Golden Week periods making domestic   travel expensive. It may also be  more difficult to find teaching jobs   during the summer holiday period from late  July to the end of August.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Is it difficult to work as language teachers in Japan when I'm not from an english speaking country?</h5>
                <p>It does tend to be difficult to find work as language teacher for an other language than English. You can try to look for private students. If you are fairly    fluent in English you might be able find work at a small school   teaching  English to children.</p>
                
                <h5>・ How much tax do working  holiday makers have to pay?</h5>
                <p>People who have been in Japan for less than 12 months have  to pay an   income tax of 20% (this is the ‘non-resident tax rate’ and it applies    to Working Holiday Makers). There is also a 8% consumer tax levied on   goods and  services.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Can I find work even if  I’ll only be staying in Japan  for a couple of months?</h5>
                <p>As wages are generally paid on a monthly basis, many employers  require   that employees work for at least three months. If you are planning to    stay for less than three months your employment opportunities will be   limited,  but there are a number of short-term jobs available.</p>
