Adds the functionality for Google Street View windows to your posts and pages without the need of a google API key.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a point and click interface to add Google Street View panorama's to your posts and pages. Click on the appropriate media-button to insert one. You can add as many panorama's as you want and style them individually using CSS.

Features:

*	Easy to use (if you have used [Google Street View](http://maps.google.com "Google Maps") before, you will recognize the interface)
*	No template hacking required
*	No API key required
*	CSS can be used in the quicktag for advanced styling
*	New in this version: address searchbox

When you add the view to the post/page, the plugin generates a `[streetview]` tag. This tags contains the location and point of view information:

> `[streetview width="100%" height="250px" lat="34.360988" lng="-86.693436" heading="-94.17771883289124" pitch="-3.342175066312998" zoom="1"][/streetview]`

The orther attributes (eg. width and height) are converted to CSS and you can add you own CSS as well. For example, this code will generate a square (500x500) street view window, with a green border:

> `[streetview border="green 1px solid" width="500px" height="500px" lat="34.360988" lng="-86.693436" heading="-94.17771883289124" pitch="-3.342175066312998" zoom="1"][/streetview]`
